# Timestamp Proof 时间戳证明

Immutable proof of existence on Neo N3 blockchain.

## Overview

Timestamp Proof creates verifiable, tamper-proof records that a document or data existed at a specific point in time. Perfect for intellectual property, legal documents, and creative works.

## Features

- **Document Hashing**: SHA-256 hash stored on-chain
- **Instant Verification**: Prove document existence
- **Legal Evidence**: Court-admissible timestamps
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple documents at once
- **Certificate Generation**: Downloadable proof certificates

## How It Works

1. Upload or drag-drop your document
2. Document hash is calculated locally (file never leaves your device)
3. Hash is recorded on Neo blockchain with timestamp
4. Receive verification certificate

## Use Cases

- Intellectual property protection
- Contract signing timestamps
- Research data integrity
- Creative work registration
